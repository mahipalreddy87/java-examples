1. Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest Id.

	Person table: Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

DELETE from Person where Id  not in
(select id from (select min(Id) as Id 
                            from Person group by Email ) as p)



2. Example: Using the same 'employees' table, let's calculate the average salary of each department using the AVG function:

𝚂𝙴𝙻𝙴𝙲𝚃 𝚍𝚎𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚝𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝, 𝙰𝚅𝙶(𝚜𝚊𝚕𝚊𝚛𝚢) 𝙾𝚅𝙴𝚁 (𝙿𝙰𝚁𝚃𝙸𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽 𝙱𝚈 𝚍𝚎𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚝𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝) 𝙰𝚂 𝚊𝚟𝚐_𝚜𝚊𝚕𝚊𝚛𝚢
𝙵𝚁𝙾𝙼 𝚎𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚢𝚎𝚎𝚜;

3. nth salary from emloyee 
	--> select * from(select ename, sal, dense_rank() over(order by sal desc)r from Employee) where r=&n;
